This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum.

in this project we have made an irc server that we could use with any standard IRC client ex: irssi, the server supports private messages and channels we can have operators and regular users on channels and also a bot (we have made one as bonus to this project).
the server supports file transfers and we have implemented the commands below specific to channel operators,

KICK - Eject a client from the channel


∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel


∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic


∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:


· i: Set/remove Invite-only channel


· t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators


· k: Set/remove the channel key (password)


· o: Give/take channel operator privilege


· l: Set/remove the user limit to channel

use make to generate an executable, then ou can follow the instructions by running the executable to run the server. after running the server you can connect to the server by any stadart irc client you wish ex:irssi.
